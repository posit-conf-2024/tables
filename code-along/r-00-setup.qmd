# Setup

If using Posit Cloud for Jupyter Notebook then go to:

- https://posit.cloud/spaces/517371/join?access_code=kDrE-6LPvl0DKfxel8knEOH57Hiz3F2sT7-hoEhZ

Then open the project called `using-gt`


If running everything in your own IDE (e.g., RStudio, VS Code, Positron, etc.) then clone this repo:

- https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/tables

Ensure that the following R libraries are installed:

```{r}
install.packages("gt")
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

To test that the installations were successful, use this:

```{r}
library(gt)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
gt(exibble)
```

```{r}
exibble |> select(num, char)
```
