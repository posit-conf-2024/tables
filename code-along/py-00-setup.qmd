# Setup

If using Posit Cloud for Jupyter Notebook then go to:

- https://posit.cloud/spaces/517371/join?access_code=kDrE-6LPvl0DKfxel8knEOH57Hiz3F2sT7-hoEhZ

Then open the project called `using-great-tables`


If running everything in your own IDE (e.g., VS Code, Positron, etc.) then clone this repo:

- https://github.com/posit-conf-2024/tables

Ensure that the following Python libraries are installed:

```bash
pip install polars great-tables
```

To test that the installations were successful, use this:

```{python}
from great_tables import GT, exibble
import polars as pl
import polars.selectors as cs
```

```{python}
GT(exibble)
```

```{python}
exibble_pl = pl.from_pandas(exibble)
```

Examples with Polars selectors:

```{python}
exibble_pl.select(cs.numeric())
```

```{python}
exibble_pl.select(cs.starts_with("date"))
```

```{python}
exibble_pl.select(cs.ends_with("time"))
```
