# Exercises: Power Generation Table

Let's do some exercises where you experiment with the API and see what's
possible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Are there better options for column widths when using `cols_width()`? Try
increasing and also decreasing the px amounts and see what the effect is on
the table. You could also try this with the `exibble` dataset.

2. Can you format the `CO2 Intensity` values as integers by using `fmt_number()`?

3. The `data_color()` function has a lot of options. Here are some ideas for
experimenting with it.

    a. Apply the function to numeric columns in `exibble`

    b. Try the same thing but only with string columns.

    c. Can you exclude certain rows when using `data_color()`?

    d. What happens when there are `NA` values in cells where `data_color()`
    is applied?

4. Try out the different font stacks in `opt_table_font()`
