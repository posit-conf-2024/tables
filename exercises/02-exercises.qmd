# Exercises: Reactions Table

This table is highly presentable and worthy of publication! You should still
experiment with the API and see what's possible. Here are some suggestions:

1. Replace `NA` values with the text `"N/A"`. And make it bold.

2. Place a label above the compound names in the stub. Can you find the method
that makes this possible?

3. Try formatting the rate constant values as decimal values with
`.fmt_number()` and also:

    a. Scale the numeric values so they are all closer to `1`

    b. Modify the units in the spanner label to reflect this scaling

    c. Add a source note to the table explaining that values are scaled

4. Try out the different themes/colors in `.opt_table_font()`

5. Change the alignment of the text in `cmpd_formula` to a center alignment (you
have to find out the name of method that does this first).
