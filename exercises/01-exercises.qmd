# Exercises: Coffee Table

Now that you have a working table, there's a few things you should experiment
with:

1. Try making the nanoplots as line plots.

2. Experiment with `nanoplot_options()`: you have to use that helper in the
`options` argument (this function needs to be imported if using Great Tables)

3. Try formatting the `*dollars` columns with `fmt_number()`, play around
with the options in that method/function to make it look like the formatting was
done with `fmt_currency()`

4. Export the table as a PNG file:

    a. Use the `.save()` method for this task with Great Tables

    b. Use `gtsave()` to save the image with gt
