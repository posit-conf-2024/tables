## Description

This workshop is all about making tables for publication and display purposes. We believe that effective tables have these things in common:

1. structuring that aids in the reading of the table
2. well-formatted values, fitting expectations for the field of study 
3. styling that reduces time to insight and improves aesthetics

This is a 'bilingual' workshop that has materials both in R and Python. The gt package will be used when teaching in R and the Great Tables package is for the Python parts. We are flexible with regard to rebalancing the instruction to either the R or Python sides. Your feedback in class will let us know where more focus should placed.

## Audience

This course is for you if you:

-   have some experience with data analysis in R or Python
-   often create reporting that involves summarizations of data
-   were frustrated making tables for display purposes outside of R or Python
-   found beautiful-looking tables in the wild and wondered: 'How could I do that?'
